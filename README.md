R codes
=======

When it comes to perform statistical analysis, data mining, visualization and sometimes even web application development, R has been my first choice of language. 
Many times, I wrote a code to help friends and co-workers solve R related problems efficiently. I decide to share some of the codes here. I hope you find them useful :)



## List of Activities

1. **[THREE_ARMIA.R](https://github.com/powerlim2/R/blob/master/R/THREE_ARIMA.R)**
	* Present 3 different ways to perform ARIMA analysis on multilevel data and compare the computational efficiency. 
	When running arima(), it turns out that 'by()' is more efficient than 'dlply()' and 'for loop'.
